    <p><i>More lore to come soon! In the meantime... Speculation ;)</i></p>

    <h3 style="color: #FFCC00"><u>Children of The Sun</u></h3>
    <p style="color: #FFCC00"><i>Homeworld: Earth</i></p>
    <p style="color: #FFCC00">
        A Religious Theocratic Monarchy based on revering the sun as a savior or divine being. In turn all Infused are treated as blessed by the sun.
        Infused serve as the generals, nobility, and other high-ranking officials. There is a large gap between them and the lower class mundane peoples.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #0099cc"><u>The First Cycle</u></h3>
    <p style="color: #0099cc"><i>Homeworld: Venus</i></p>
    <p style="color: #0099cc">
        Following The Event, the First Cycle sought out to discover the inner workings of what happened exactly and how the Infused and Solar Minerals have come about exactly. 
        They have set up their capital center on Venus to be closer to the sun. The First Cycle is a Tech-Driven prosperous nation that looks down on the others and see them as uncivilized and often undeserving of the knowledge they have gained.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #cc3300"><u>Old World Coalition</u></h3>
    <p style="color: #cc3300"><i>Homeworld: Mars</i></p>
    <p style="color: #cc3300">
        The Old World Coalition was born out of the earliest colonies on Mars, The Old World Coalition established independance only a few decades before The Event.
        As the original earth population slid into what the Martians saw as theocratic insanity, the Old World Coalition sought to preserve what remained of the cultures of modern earth.
        In time, they offically declared sovereignty over Mars and fought a hard revolutionary war with the newly cristined Children of the Sun. The Patriotic pride of the OWC is unmatched, and they highly value personal freedom of choice and expression.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #999966"><u>Gas Giant Collective</u></h3>
    <p style="color: #999966"><i>Homeworld: Saturn (Strong Jupiter Presence)</i></p>
    <p style="color: #999966">
        The Gas Giant Collective was originally the collection of earth's far flung mining operations. After the rise of the Children of the Sun, Infused and Solar Minerals made the mining stations increasingly obsolete and caused them to be abandoned. 
        Far from the sun, the people of the GGC struggle to scrape out traditional lives mostly void of Solar influence.
