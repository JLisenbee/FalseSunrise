    <h3 id="definitions"><u>Term Definitions</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Component</u>: A blanket term for all the Weapons and Upgrades on a ship.</li>
        <li><u>Die Rolls (YdX, dX, and X+)</u>: When rolling dice, these short hands are commonly used throughout the rules of False Sunrise:
        <li><ul>
            <li><u>YdX and dX</u>: This shorthand means "Roll Y dice each with X sides and sum the results." In the case of "dX", just roll one die with X sides.</li>
            <li><u>X+</u>: This shorthand means "Roll a six-sided die. if the result is greater than or equal to X, the roll is a success."</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><u>Fleet</u>: A player's total force, comprised of all ships controlled by them.</li>
        <li><u>Point Defense</u>: Specific designation on some Upgrades that communicate that they are meant to engage missiles (and possibly eventually Small Craft.)</li>
        <li><u>Ship</u>: Spacefaring vessel, making up a player's fleet. Has Systems, Integrity, and Thrust, all of which are recorded on the Ship Sheet. Ship's can be represented by anything that has a clear center and a clear "forward" direction. Models/game pieces for ships do not matter, as ship's in False Sunrise are always only considered to be the centerpoints of the gamepieces used.</li>
        <li><u>System</u>: A blanket term for all Weapons and Upgrades on a ship, as well as some "built in" things including Engines, Fire Control, and the Command Bridge.</li>
        <li><u>Thrust</u>: A ship's ability to alter it's velocity and direction.</li>
        <li><u>Upgrade</u>: Non-offensive modules installed on a ship, a list can be found under their own section below.</li>
        <li><u>Velocity</u>: A ship's actual current speed.</li>
        <li><u>Weapon</u>: Any directly offensive parts of the ship that deal damage, strictly Direct Fire and Missile weapons (does not include Point Defenses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="setup"><u>Pregame Setup</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4' x 6' play area with ~7-10 Pieces of terrain. Terrain is impassable and blocks line of sight.</li>
        <li>Players roll a die. <b>This is the initiative roll. The player that won the initive roll has the initiative.</b></li>
        <li>The player who has the initiative places an objective marker anywhere on the play area 12" from any table edge and not on any terrain.</li>
        <li>Players alternate placing objective markers in this manner, with each one also at least 9" from each other, until 5 objective markers are placed. </li>
        <li>The person who has the initiative chooses a board edge and places all of their ships within 12" of that edge. Then the player does not places all their ships in the same manner on the opposite edge.</li>
    <li>Play begins. <b>Ships start at 6 Thrust.</b></li>

    <h3 id="turn"><u>Turn Structure</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Order Phase</u>: Players secretly note their movement orders (rules for this is found in "Movement" below). Players then simultaneously reveal those orders. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Movement Phase</u>: For each ship, move it in accordance to the rules in "Movement" below. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Weapons Phase</u>: The player who has the initiative chooses one ship to fire any or all of it's weapons. Then the player who does not chooses a ship to do the same. Alternate back and forth until all ships have fired.</li>
        <li><u>Points Phase</u>: Calculate points earned for this turn. (Refer to "Winning" below)</li>
        <li><u>End Phase</u>: Initiative transfers to the player who did not have it at the beginning of the turn, the turn ends, and the next turn begins.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><u>^Jump to Top^</u></a>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="movement"><u>Movement</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a thrust value representing the power of their engines. This is not the actual distance a ship will move in a turn, but rather the "currency" they can spend to change the amount.</li>
        <li><u>Accelerating</u>: Up to all of a ship's thrust can go towards increasing it's velocity. A ship is not required to accelerate or decelerate, and instead choose to maintain it's current velocity.</li>
        <li><u>Changing course</u>: Up to half of a ship's thrust can be used to make course changes. Courses changes are made either to Port (left) or Starboard (right) and each point of course change changes the couyrse of the ship by one "hour" distance as if referencing a clock face (See included Tool). Course changes are always all port or all starboard, and cannot be split between the two.</li>
        <li><u>Executing Movement</u>: Movement is carried out following the steps below.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded down.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded down.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>If a ship's path when moving would intersect a piece of terrain</b> it immediately stops, then it takes damage equal to it's current velocity, then it's velocity is reduced to zero.</li>
        <li><b>If a ship's movement would move it off the field</b> remove the ship from the board. Note the point where it left. At the end of the next turn, reset it's velocity to 6, place it anywhere within 3" of the point it left the board, and face it any heading.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><u>^Jump to Top^</u></a>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="winning"><u>Winning</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a ship moves within 3" of the center of an objective marker, that marker is now controlled by them.</li>
        <li>If more than one player moved within 3" of an objective marker during a single movement phase, that point remains in the state it was in at the beginning of the turn. (It remains under the control of whoever controlled it, or remains neutral if no one controlled it.)</li>
        <li>At the end of each round (after all ships have had a chance to shoot), each player earns one point for each marker controlled by them.</li>
        <li><b>Once a player has earned 15 points, the game ends and that player wins.</b></li>

    <h3 id="force"><u>Force Construction</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Choosing a Total Integrity</u>: When constructing a force, first decide on a maximum amount of integrity points each team's fleet should total up to. </li>
        <li>Ship hulls have an associated integrity value based on their relative size and capability, and equal integrity per fleet insures roughly equal sides (A good starting point is 20)</li>
        <li><u>Optional: Choosing a Faction</u>: Adding factions adds new depth and strategy to the game, so it's recommended to use them, but perhaps only after your first few games of False Sunrise.</li> 
        <li>If both players agree to, at this point, each player may choose a Faction their fleet will be a member of. For each player, their fleet has the Faction Rule active for the furation of the game, and can choose the special Weapons and Upgrades unique to their faction during the "Mounting Components" step of Force Construction.</li>
        <li>To see the list of the factions, the unique Faction Rules, and the unique faction Weapons and Upgrades, and some lore on each one, <a href="factions.html" target="_blank">Click This Link</a></li>
        <li><u>Choosing Hulls</u>: Ship hulls have a number of slots for components (weapons and upgrades) equal to their integrity value. Players choose the hulls they wish to use up to the agreed upon Total Integrity.</li>
        <li><u>Mounting Components</u>: For each ship hull, you choose a number of components (weapons or upgrades) from the lists below equal to the Ship hull's integrity value. Any limitations or special rules for mounting a component will be noted in the descripion of that component.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><u>^Jump to Top^</u></a>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="hull"><u>Ships and Hulls</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a number of slots for components equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li>Ships have a number of Integrity Rows, 6 pips each, equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li><b>When a ship takes damage,</b> mark off pips one row at a time in one row equal to the damage dealt. All damage is dealt in that row until that row is depleted.</li>
        <li>When a row is depleted, the ship's controller chooses one System (list below) on the ship to be destroyed.</li>
        <li>When all rows are depleted, the ship is destroyed and removed from the field.</li>
        <li>List of Systems: 
        <ul>
            <li>Each Component is a System. When a Component is destroyed, it's effect no longer applies if it's an upgrade, or it cannot be fired if it's a weapon.</li>
            <li>Engines: While a ship's Engines are destroyed, this ship's thrust is reduced to half it's original value.</li>
            <li>Fire Control: While a ship's Fire Control is destroyed, subtract 3 from the die roll when shooting direct fire weapons on this ship, and subtract 2 from the accuracy rolls when firing missile weapons from this ship.</li>
            <li>Control Bridge: While a ship's Control Bridge is destroyed, If this ship increases or decreases velocity or changes course during the movement phase, it may not also fire weapons during the weapons phase.</li>

    <h3 id="dfweapon"><u>Direct Fire Weapons</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct fire weapons fire out of the fore arc, the port (left) arc, the starboard (right) arc, or the rear arc.<b>This is chosen during force creation.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The easiest way to define arcs is imagining the ship is at the center of a clock face, and thinking of the arcs in reference to the "hours" on the clock. Using the course change tool is helpful for this, it even has the arcs marked out.</li>
            <li><u>Fore Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 10 and 11 o'clock, to the center between 1 and 2 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Port Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 11 and 12 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Starboard Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 1 and 2 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Rear Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>

            <li><u>Choose Weapons</u>: Choose any number of direct fire weapons mounted on the ship to fire.</li>
            <li><u>Declare Targets</u>: For each weapon chosen to fire, choose a number of targets up to the weapon's Attacks characteristic that are within the weapon's stated firing arc (or arcs in the case of a turret upgrade) and within line of sight.</li>
            <li><u>Determine Range</u>: For each target, divide it's distance in inches from the attacking ship by the range characteristic of the weapon being fired and round up. The result is the Range Band that the target is within.</li>
            <li><u>Determine To-Hit value</u>: In Range Band 1, direct fire weapons hit on 2+. For each subsequent range band, the To-Hit number increases by 1. (3+ for Range Band 2, 4+ For Range Band 3, etc.)</li>
            <li><u>Roll To Hit</u>: For each weapon being fired, for each Attack, roll to see if it hits the target using the To-Hit value calculated previously.</li>
            <li><u>Deal damage</u>: For each Attack that hit it's target, deal an amount of damage to that target equal to the Damage value of the weapon that made the attack.</li>
            <li><u>Roll for Additional Critical Hits</u>: If the target was a ship, after applying damage, for each attack that hit the target, check the number of pips remaining in the target's lowest non-empty integrity bar.

    <h3 id="smallcraft"><u>Small Craft</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small Craft are small squadrons of aerospace craft, often deployed from Hanger upgrades on the larger ships.</li>
        <li>Small Craft begin the game in Hangaer Upgrades on the main Ships. Each Hanger Upgrade by default holds One Squadron of any available. When the upgrade is added, note the type of squadron it will start off holding. (All ships may take the Fighter and Bomber squadrons below. Each faction also has a faction-specific quadron that may be available)</li>
        <li>Small craft move, fight, and activate, very differently from the main Ships in False Sunrise. The rules on how to use them are below.</li>
        <li><u>Parts of a Small Craft Squadron:</u> 
        <ul>
            <li><u>Squadron Size:</u> The Squadron Size represents how many shots from the squadron's Small Craft Weapon the squadron makes when it attacks, and also how many hits it can take. <b>Whenever a squadron takes damage, reduce it's squadron size by the damage dealt to it.</b></li>
            <li><u>Speed:</u> The Speed of a squadron defines the distance squadron can move in a turn when activated. Squadrons do not move like normal ships. They do not receive orders during the movement phase, instead <b>when they are activated they may move up to their speed any time during that activation, following any path as long as the distance traveled does not exceed their Speed over the course of the entire activation</b></li>
            <li><u>Small Craft Weapon:</u> The Small Craft Weapon has three parts. Accuracy vs. Small Craft, Accuracy vs. Capital Ships, and Damage. Accuracy vs. Small Craft is the result on the defines the minimum roll needed for an attack from the Small Craft Weapon. Accuracy vs. Capital Ship's is similar, but for large ships. Finally, Damage is the damage the Small Craft Weapon deals per hit.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Deploying Small Craft:</u> 
            <ul>
                <li>For each ship with a Hangar upgrade, declare how many squadrons that ship will launch during the Order Phase. Mark those Hangar upgrades as "empty"</li>
                <li>At each point during its movement when a ship launching small craft would apply half of its course change (beginning of its movement, and halfway through) place half of the Small Craft squadrons being deployed this turn within 2 inches of the ship's position at that point in the movement. (Round down for the first turn, round up for the second).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Using Small Craft:</u> 
            <ul>
                <li><u>Activation:</u> Any time a player could activate a ship during the Weapons Phase, that player may instead choose to activate a Small Craft Squadron. During that activation, the player may move that squadron up to it's speed, attack with that Squadron's Small Craft Weapon, and/or take any other actions available to that Squadron (Perhaps from a Special Hangar Upgrade)</li>
                <li><u>Making and Attack:</u> Any time during it's Activation, a Squadron may attack with it's Small Craft Weapons at any targets within 2" of the Squadron. To make the attack, roll a number fo d6's equal to the current squadron size. For each die with a result equal to or greater than the accuracy profile corresponding to the type of target being attacked, deal damage to the target equal to the damage profile of the Squadron.</li>
                <li><ul><li>If the target is a Ship with Point Defense upgrades, those upgrades may retaliate. When the attack is declared from the Squadron, but before the rolls are made, all Point Defense upgrades on the target ship and all Point Defense upgrades on other ships who's range's include the target ship activate. Those point defenses roll their associated dice, and deal damage to the attacking squadron equal to the number rolled. Then the attack proceeds as normal using the new squadron size.</li></ul></li>
                <li><u>Docking:</u> If a Small Craft is within 2" of a Ship with an empty Hangar upgrade during it's activation, that Squadron may to dock with that ship. Remove the Squadron from the Field, note the type of Squadron that docked on the Ship Sheet for the docking Ship. No need to note the Squadron Size as relaunched squadrons are launched at maximum Squadron Size.</li>
                <li><u>Taking Damage:</u> If a Squadron is dealt damage, reduce it's Squadron Size by the damage dealt. A Squadron is destroyed if it's current Squadron Size is reduced to zero.</li>
                <li><u>Being Destroyed:</u> When a Squadron is destroyed, remove it from the board.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Notes on Small Craft vs. Capital Ships:</u> 
            <ul>
                <li>Capital Ship weapons fired at small craft follow the exact same rules as they would for firing at another Ship, but the damage characteristic is always 1.</li>
                <li>Small Craft cannot capture objectives, or deny an opponent from capturing an objective, by being within 3" of that objective.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h4>May 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Measure Tool Download Link</li>
        <li>Repair Crews: Added "Instead of restoring integrity points, you may instead choose to restore two destroyed systems" option to the rules text (System-Attacking strategies such as railgun spam need a release valve. Other upgrades may be proposed for similar adjustments)</li>
        <li>New Upgrade: Away Crews</li>
        <li>Small Craft Rules! New Upgrades to support this update: Efficient Hangars, Fabricator, Flight Deck, Nanite Repair Swarm, Reserve Reinforcements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Artillery: AP 1 -> 2 (Two Consecutive hits from Artillery pieces will still each proc crit rolls)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy Lance: Damage 3 -> 4 (Procs crit roll on one hit, but always destroys with both hits)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 16, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Repair Crews: "If this repair fills an integrity bar," -> "For each integrity bar this repair fills,"</li>
        <li>Railgun: Attacks 2 -> 3 (~75-87% chance to destroy a system every salvo is a big step towards making the Railgun perform it's intended job.)</li>
        <li>Millstone: Attacks 2 -> 3 (<i>Could</i> remove one whole integrity bar in a single salvo (~30% chance of all three hitting), but probably wont. Makes Millstone worth not ignoring)</li>
        <li>Artillery: Damage 6 -> 5 (No weapon should one shot a Corvette with no downside or without real work, forces the shooter to commit more than just one resource to one kill.)</li>
        <li>Torpedo: Damage 9 -> 8 (Most defensive upgrades will prevent the elimination of one row, most of the time.)</li>
        <li>Direct Fire Weapons: Step 7: Roll Additonal Crits, Added "for each attack that hit the target," (Clarifies that weapons with AP values >0 and multiple attacks should be rolling multiple times if more than one attack hits)</li>
        <li>Added Sub-Lists for jumping to weapon tables</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 6, 2024</h4>
