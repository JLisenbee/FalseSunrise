    <h1><u>False Sunrise: Naval Wargame</u></h1>

    <h3><a href="./9Ships.png" download="ShipSheet"><u>Ship Sheet Download Link</u></a></h3>

    <h3><u>Proposed Features/Changes</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small Craft (Hanger Module that holds one squadron, PD can shoot at squadrons, different types?)</li>
        <li>Factions (Each Will at least add 3 new weapons, 3 new upgrades, 1 new type of small craft, and a team-wide effect)</li>
        <li>Remove missile accuracy stat and add an accuracy stat to PD: Missiles may have too many "feels bad" points tht make them not worth taking/would make them hard to balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Term Definitions</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Component</u>: A blanket term for all the Weapons and Upgrades on a ship.</li>
        <li><u>Fleet</u>: A player's total force, comprised of all ships controlled by them.</li>
        <li><u>Point Defense</u>: Specific designation on some Upgrades that communicate that they are meant to engage missiles (and possibly eventually Small Craft.)</li>
        <li><u>Ship</u>: Spacefaring vessel, making up a player's fleet. Has Systems, Integrity, and Thrust, all of which are recorded on the Ship Sheet. Ship's can be represented by anything that has a clear center and a clear "forward" direction. Models/game pieces for ships do not matter, as ship's in False Sunrise are always only considered to be the centerpoints of the gamepieces used.</li>
        <li><u>System</u>: A blanket term for all Weapons and Upgrades on a ship, as well as some "built in" things including Engines, Fire Control, and the Command Bridge.</li>
        <li><u>Thrust</u>: A ship's ability to alter it's velocity and direction.</li>
        <li><u>Upgrade</u>: Non-offensive modules installed on a ship, a list can be found under their own section below.</li>
        <li><u>Velocity</u>: A ship's actual current speed.</li>
        <li><u>Weapon</u>: Any directly offensive parts of the ship that deal damage, strictly Direct Fire and Missile weapons (does not include Point Defenses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Pregame Setup</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4' x 6' play area with ~7-10 Pieces of terrain. Terrain is impassable and blocks line of sight.</li>
        <li>Players roll a die. <b>This is the initiative roll. The player that won the initive roll has the initiative.</b></li>
        <li>The player who has the initiative places an objective marker anywhere on the play area 12" from any table edge and not on any terrain.</li>
        <li>Players alternate placing objective markers in this manner, with each one also at least 9" from each other, until 5 objective markers are placed. </li>
        <li>The person who has the initiative chooses a board edge and places all of their ships within 12" of that edge. Then the player does not places all their ships in the same manner on the opposite edge.</li>
    <li>Play begins. <b>Ships start at 6 Thrust.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Turn Structure</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Order Phase</u>: Players secretly note their movement orders (rules for this is found in "Movement" below). Players then simultaneously reveal those orders. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Movement Phase</u>: For each ship, move it in accordance to the rules in "Movement" below. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Weapons Phase</u>: The player who has the initiative chooses one ship to fire any or all of it's weapons. Then the player who does not chooses a ship to do the same. Alternate back and forth until all ships have fired.</li>
        <li><u>Points Phase</u>: Calculate points earned for this turn. (Refer to "Winning" below)</li>
        <li><u>End Phase</u>: Initiative transfers to the player who did not have it at the beginning of the turn, the turn ends, and the next turn begins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Movement</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a thrust value representing the power of their engines. This is not the actual distance a ship will move in a turn, but rather the "currency" they can spend to change the amount.</li>
        <li><u>Accelerating</u>: Up to all of a ship's thrust can go towards increasing it's velocity. A ship is not required to accelerate or decelerate, and instead choose to maintain it's current velocity.</li>
        <li><u>Changing course</u>: Up to half of a ship's thrust can be used to make course changes. Courses changes are made either to Port (left) or Starboard (right) and each point of course change changes the couyrse of the ship by one "hour" distance as if referencing a clock face (See included Tool). Course changes are always all port or all starboard, and cannot be split between the two.</li>
        <li><u>Executing Movement</u>: Movement is carried out following the steps below.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded down.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded down.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>If a ship's path when moving would intersect a piece of terrain</b> it immediately stops, then it takes damage equal to it's current velocity, then it's velocity is reduced to zero.</li>
        <li><b>If a ship's movement would move it off the field</b> remove the ship from the board. Note the point where it left. At the end of the next turn, reset it's velocity to 6, place it anywhere within 3" of the point it left the board, and face it any heading.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Winning</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a ship moves within 3" of the center of an objective marker, that marker is now controlled by them.</li>
        <li>If more than one player moved within 3" of an objective marker during a single movement phase, that point remains in the state it was in at the beginning of the turn. (It remains under the control of whoever controlled it, or remains neutral if no one controlled it.)</li>
        <li>At the end of each round (after all ships have had a chance to shoot), each player earns one point for each marker controlled by them.</li>
        <li><b>Once a player has earned 15 points, the game ends and that player wins.</b></li>  
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Force Construction</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Choosing a Total Integrity</u>: When constructing a force, first decide on a maximum amount of integrity points each team's fleet should total up to. </li>
        <li>Ship hulls have an associated integrity value based on their relative size and capability, and equal integrity per fleet insures roughly equal sides (A good starting point is 20)</li>
        <li><u>Choosing Hulls</u>: Ship hulls have a number of slots for components (weapons and upgrades) equal to their integrity value. Players choose the hulls they wish to use up to the agreed upon Total Integrity.</li>
        <li><u>Mounting Components</u>: For each ship hull, you choose a number of components (weapons or upgrades) from the lists below equal to the Ship hull's integrity value. Any limitations or special rules for mounting a component will be noted in the descripion of that component.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Hulls</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a number of slots for components equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li>Ships have a number of Integrity Rows, 6 pips each, equal to their integrity.</li>
        <li>When a row is depleted, the ship's controller chooses one System (list below) on the ship to be destroyed.</li>
        <li>When all rows are depleted, the ship is destroyed and removed from the field.</li>
        <li>List of Systems: 
        <ul>
            <li>Each Component is a System. When a Component is destroyed, it's effect no longer applies if it's an upgrade, or it cannot be fired if it's a weapon.</li>
            <li>Engines: While a ship's Engines are destroyed, this ship's thrust is reduced to half it's original value.</li>
            <li>Fire Control: While a ship's Fire Control is destroyed, subtract 3 from the die roll when shooting direct fire weapons on this ship, and subtract 2 from the accuracy rolls when firing missile weapons from this ship.</li>
            <li>Control Bridge: While a ship's Control Bridge is destroyed, If this ship increases or decreases velocity or changes course during the movement phase, it may not also fire weapons during the weapons phase.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Direct Fire Weapons</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct fire weapons fire out of the fore arc, the port (left) arc, the starboard (right) arc, or the rear arc.<b>This is chosen during force creation.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The easiest way to define arcs is imagining the ship is at the center of a clock face, and thinking of the arcs in reference to the "hours" on the clock. Using the course change tool is helpful for this, it even has the arcs marked out.</li>
            <li><u>Fore Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 10 and 11 o'clock, to the center between 1 and 2 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Port Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 11 and 12 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Starboard Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 1 and 2 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Rear Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Direct Fire Weapons require line of sight.</li>
        <li>To Fire Direct Fire weapons: Choose a weapon to fire, Choose Targets, Determine which range band the target is in, Roll to Hit, Deal Damage, Check Armor Piercing. Repeat for each Direct Fire weapon fired.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a defined number of attacks. When firing this weapon, shoot it that many times. You may split those shots among any number of targets, chosen when activating the ship the weapon is attached to.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a defined range. This range defines the length of the Range Bands (RB) that weapon uses. (The weapon's range is RB 1, 2x that range is RB 2, 3x that range is RB 3, etc). </li>
        <li>Weapons hit on 2+ in Range Band 1, and the difficulty increases by 1 for each subsequent range band (RB 2 is 3+, RB 3 is 4+, etc). This means RB 5 is effectively the maximum range of a weapon, barring any modifiers</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a Damage value. Weapons deal damage based on their Damage Value to the target's integrity.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have an Armor Piercing value. After dealing damage to a ship, check the ship's remaining integrity. If the armor piercing value is greater than the number of integrity points left in the current row, roll a d6. On a 4+, the target chooses and other system on the ship to be destroyed.</li>

    <h3><u>Missile Weapons</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Missile weapons can be fired in all directions.</li>
        <li>Missile weapons require line of sight to their target.</li>
        <li>To Fire Missiles: Choose a missile weapon to fire, Choose Targets, Roll accuracy for each missile, Enemy Engages Point Defense, Deal Damage. Repeat for each missile weapon fired.</li>
        <li>Missile weapons have a defined number of attacks. When firing missile weapons, fire that many missiles. You may split those missiles among any number of targets.</li>
        <li>Missile weapons have a minimum range. They cannot be fired at any targets within this range, but can be fired at targets beyond this range.</li>
        <li>Missiles have a defined Accuracy. They hit the target on that value or higher on a d6.</li>
        <li>Missiles have a defined Durability value. Sum up all damage values of point defenses on the target ship and of all point defenses on other ships that the target ship is within range of. This is the PD Pool.</li>
        <li>If there are are least a number of points in the PD Pool equal the Durability of an incoming missile, subtract that missile's durability from the PD Pool. Then that missile is considered destroyed. Repeat this process until all incoming missiles are destroyed, or the PD Pool has less points than an incoming missile's durability. </li>
        <li>If any incoming missiles remain, those missiles deal damage to the target according to their damage value.</li>
