    <p><i>False Sunrise's Combat mechanics have undergone a HUGE overhaul! I've done my best to compile the changes in the changelog below, but when doing aything with weapons or small craft, revisit the sections for those rules to make sure you're caught up on the new rules!</i></p>
    <p><i>Unfortunately, the ship sheet is a little outdated. It's still pretty servicable, but doesn't yet have a spot for defenses. I'm aware and will be fixing it!</i></p>

    <h3 id="proposed"><u>Proposed Features/Changes</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><s>Small Craft (Hanger Module that holds one squadron, PD can shoot at squadrons, different types?)</s></li>
        <li><s>Factions (Each will at least add 3 new weapons, 3 new upgrades, 1 new type of small craft, and a team-wide effect)</s> See the notes above!</li>
        <li><s>Remove missile accuracy stat and add an accuracy stat to PD: Missiles may have too many "feels bad" points tht make them not worth taking/would make them hard to balance.</s> Made Point Defenses use dice instead.</li>
        <li>Seperate Upgrades into defensive, offensive, mobility, hanger, etc.</li>
        <li>Add some more factions weapons? Lowered diversity in dials to turn for weapons has resulted in cutting down to one new weapons each.</li>
        <li>You have any cool ideas on what should be included? Message me on Discord @ stronghold258!</li>

    <h3 id="definitions"><u>Term Definitions</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Component</u>: A blanket term for all the Weapons and Upgrades on a ship.</li>
        <li><u>Die Rolls (YdX, dX, and X+)</u>: When rolling dice, these short hands are commonly used throughout the rules of False Sunrise:
        <li><ul>
            <li><u>YdX and dX</u>: This shorthand means "Roll Y dice each with X sides and sum the results." In the case of "dX", just roll one die with X sides.</li>
            <li><u>X+</u>: This shorthand means "Roll a six-sided die. if the result is greater than or equal to X, the roll is a success."</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><u>Fleet</u>: A player's total force, comprised of all ships controlled by them.</li>
        <li><u>Point Defense</u>: Specific designation on some Upgrades that communicate that they are meant to engage missiles (and possibly eventually Small Craft.)</li>
        <li><u>Ship</u>: Spacefaring vessel, making up a player's fleet. Has Systems, Integrity, and Thrust, all of which are recorded on the Ship Sheet. Ship's can be represented by anything that has a clear center and a clear "forward" direction. Models/game pieces for ships do not matter, as ship's in False Sunrise are always only considered to be the centerpoints of the gamepieces used.</li>
        <li><u>System</u>: A blanket term for all Weapons and Upgrades on a ship, as well as some "built in" things including Engines, Fire Control, and the Command Bridge.</li>
        <li><u>Thrust</u>: A ship's ability to alter it's velocity and direction.</li>
        <li><u>Upgrade</u>: Non-offensive modules installed on a ship, a list can be found under their own section below.</li>
        <li><u>Velocity</u>: A ship's actual current speed.</li>
        <li><u>Weapon</u>: Any directly offensive parts of the ship that deal damage, strictly Direct Fire and Missile weapons (does not include Point Defenses).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="setup"><u>Pregame Setup</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4' x 6' play area with ~7-10 Pieces of terrain. Terrain is impassable and blocks line of sight.</li>
        <li>Players roll a die. <b>This is the initiative roll. The player that won the initive roll has the initiative.</b></li>
        <li>The player who has the initiative places an objective marker anywhere on the play area 12" from any table edge and not on any terrain.</li>
        <li>Players alternate placing objective markers in this manner, with each one also at least 9" from each other, until 5 objective markers are placed. </li>
        <li>The person who has the initiative chooses a board edge and places all of their ships within 12" of that edge. Then the player does not places all their ships in the same manner on the opposite edge.</li>
    <li>Play begins. <b>Ships start at 6 Thrust.</b></li>

    <h3 id="turn"><u>Turn Structure</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Order Phase</u>: Players secretly note their movement orders (rules for this is found in "Movement" below). Players then simultaneously reveal those orders. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Movement Phase</u>: For each ship, move it in accordance to the rules in "Movement" below. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Weapons Phase</u>: The player who has the initiative chooses one ship to fire any or all of it's weapons. Then the player who does not chooses a ship to do the same. Alternate back and forth until all ships have fired.</li>
        <li><u>Points Phase</u>: Calculate points earned for this turn. (Refer to "Winning" below)</li>
        <li><u>End Phase</u>: Initiative transfers to the player who did not have it at the beginning of the turn, the turn ends, and the next turn begins.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><u>^Jump to Top^</u></a>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="movement"><u>Movement</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a thrust value representing the power of their engines. This is not the actual distance a ship will move in a turn, but rather the "currency" they can spend to change the amount.</li>
        <li><u>Accelerating</u>: Up to all of a ship's thrust can go towards increasing it's velocity. A ship is not required to accelerate or decelerate, and instead choose to maintain it's current velocity.</li>
        <li><u>Changing course</u>: Up to half of a ship's thrust can be used to make course changes. Courses changes are made either to Port (left) or Starboard (right) and each point of course change changes the couyrse of the ship by one "hour" distance as if referencing a clock face (See included Tool). Course changes are always all port or all starboard, and cannot be split between the two.</li>
        <li><u>Executing Movement</u>: Movement is carried out following the steps below.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded down.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded down.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>If a ship's path when moving would intersect a piece of terrain</b> it immediately stops, then it takes damage equal to it's current velocity, then it's velocity is reduced to zero.</li>
        <li><b>If a ship's movement would move it off the field</b> remove the ship from the board. Note the point where it left. At the end of the next turn, reset it's velocity to 6, place it anywhere within 3" of the point it left the board, and face it any heading.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href="#title"><u>^Jump to Top^</u></a>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="winning"><u>Winning</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a ship moves within 3" of the center of an objective marker, that marker is now controlled by them.</li>
        <li>If more than one player moved within 3" of an objective marker during a single movement phase, that point remains in the state it was in at the beginning of the turn. (It remains under the control of whoever controlled it, or remains neutral if no one controlled it.)</li>
        <li>At the end of each round (after all ships have had a chance to shoot), each player earns one point for each marker controlled by them.</li>
        <li><b>Once a player has earned 15 points, the game ends and that player wins.</b></li>

    <h3 id="force"><u>Force Construction</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Choosing a Total Integrity</u>: When constructing a force, first decide on a maximum amount of integrity points each team's fleet should total up to. </li>
        <li>Ship hulls have an associated integrity value based on their relative size and capability, and equal integrity per fleet insures roughly equal sides (A good starting point is 20)</li>
        <li><u>Optional: Choosing a Faction</u>: Adding factions adds new depth and strategy to the game, so it's recommended to use them, but perhaps only after your first few games of False Sunrise.</li> 
        <li>If both players agree to, at this point, each player may choose a Faction their fleet will be a member of. For each player, their fleet has the Faction Rule active for the furation of the game, and can choose the special Weapons and Upgrades unique to their faction during the "Mounting Components" step of Force Construction.</li>
        <li>To see the list of the factions, the unique Faction Rules, and the unique faction Weapons and Upgrades, and some lore on each one, <a href="factions.html" target="_blank">Click This Link</a></li>
        <li><u>Choosing Hulls</u>: Ship hulls have a number of slots for components (weapons and upgrades) equal to their integrity value. Players choose the hulls they wish to use up to the agreed upon Total Integrity.</li>
        <li><u>Mounting Components</u>: For each ship hull, you choose a number of components (weapons or upgrades) from the lists below equal to the Ship hull's integrity value. Any limitations or special rules for mounting a component will be noted in the descripion of that component.</li>
        <li><u>Mounting Defenses</u>: For each ship hull, you choose 3 defenses to mount on the hull. The effect of defenses can be found under the Ships and Hulls description.</li>

    <hr style="border-top: 1px solid; opacity: 0.3">

    <h3 id="hull"><u>Ships and Hulls</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a number of slots for components equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li>Ships have a number of Integrity Rows, 6 pips each, equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li><b>When a ship takes damage,</b> mark off pips one row at a time in one row equal to the damage dealt. All damage is dealt in that row until that row is depleted.</li>
        <li>When a row is depleted, the ship's controller chooses one System (list below) on the ship to be destroyed.</li>
        <li>When all rows are depleted, the ship is destroyed and removed from the field.</li>
        <li>List of Systems: 
        <ul>
            <li>Each Component is a System. When a Component is destroyed, it's effect no longer applies if it's an upgrade, or it cannot be fired if it's a weapon.</li>
            <li>Engines: While a ship's Engines are destroyed, this ship's thrust is reduced to half it's original value.</li>
            <li>Fire Control: While a ship's Fire Control is destroyed, Reduce the value of each rolled attack dice by 2.</li>
            <li>Control Bridge: While a ship's Control Bridge is destroyed, If this ship increases or decreases velocity or changes course during the movement phase, it may not also fire weapons during the weapons phase.</li>

    <h3 id="weapon"><u>Direct Fire Weapons</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>With the exception of Missile weapons, weapons fire out of the fore arc, the port (left) arc, the starboard (right) arc, or the rear arc. <b>This is chosen during force creation.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The easiest way to define arcs is imagining the ship is at the center of a clock face, and thinking of the arcs in reference to the "hours" on the clock. Using the course change tool is helpful for this, it even has the arcs marked out.</li>
            <li><u>Fore Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 10 and 11 o'clock, to the center between 1 and 2 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Port Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 11 and 12 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Starboard Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 1 and 2 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>
            <li><u>Rear Arc</u>: Spans from between the center between 7 and 8 o'clock, to the center between 4 and 5 o'clock.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>To Fire weapons, follow these steps in order</b>:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Choose Weapons</u>: Choose any number of direct fire weapons mounted on the ship to fire.</li>
            <li><u>Declare Targets</u>: For each weapon chosen to fire, choose target to fire at within it's firing arc and within line of sight of the attacking ship.</li>
            <li><u>Determine Range</u>: For each target, Determine what range band it is in. Range bands are numbered, starting from 1. Range band 1, or RB1, is defined as 0" to 6" from the attacking ship, RB2 is 6"-12", RB3 is 12"-18", etc. If a target is directly on the line between two range bands, count it as being in the closer of the two.</li>
            <li><u>Determine Number of Attack Dice</u>: Weapons each have a defined Range characteristic, corresponding to the Range Band it is most effective in. If the target from the "Determine Range" step is in the listed band, roll 4 Attack Dice. If It is in either of the adjacent range bands, instead roll 2. Attack dice are six sided dice.</li>
            <li><u>Apply Defenses</u>: Subtract a number of dice from the total rolled, starting with the highest dice down to the lowest, equal to the Defense Value of the target ship corresponding to the type of weapon used to attack it. An attack can only be reduced down to a minimum of one attack die (It will be the lowest one rolled). If the Defense value of the target ship happens to be negative, instead add a number of attack dice to the attack roll equal to the amount the defenses are below zero.</li>
            <li><u>Apply Damage</u>: Total up the results of the remaining dice. Apply that damage to the Integrity of the target ship. For each Integrity Bar reduced to zero pips, destroy one component on the target ship.</li>

    <h3 id="smallcraft"><u>Small Craft</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small Craft are small squadrons of aerospace craft, deployed from Hanger upgrades on the larger ships.</li>
        <li>Small Craft begin the game in Hangar Upgrades on the main Ships. Each Hanger Upgrade by default holds One Squadron of any available. When the upgrade is added during force creation, note the type of squadron it will start off holding. (All ships may take the Fighter and Bomber squadrons below. Each faction also has a faction-specific squadron that may be available)</li>
        <li>Small Craft work very differently from the main Ships in False Sunrise. The rules on how to use them are below.</li>
        <li><u>Parts of a Small Craft Squadron:</u> 
        <ul>
            <li><u>Squadron Size:</u> Squadron Size describes how many craft are in each group. <b>When squadron size is depleted, the squadron is destroyed.</b></li>
            <li><u>Toughness:</u> The toughness describes each individual Craft's ability to evade or resist various defenses against them.</li>
            <li><u>Effect Ladder:</u> The effect ladder describes the effect the squadron has when on offense while it is in each of three states: Greater than 2/3 squadron size (rounded up), 2/3 squadron size (rounded down) to 1/3 Squadron size (rounded up), and less than 1/3 squadron size (rounded down)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Deploying Small Craft:</u> 
            <ul>
                <li>During the order phase, note which ships will be launching small craft. At the beginning of the Weapons phase, Those ships may launch any of their squadrons. Mark those Hangar upgrades as "empty". Launched squadrons are considered deployed until they dock.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Using and Interacting with Small Craft:</u> 
            <ul>
                <li>At the beginning of the weapons phase, before any ships are activated and starting with the player who has the initiative, players alternate giving orders to each of their deployed squadrons.</li>
                <li>Squadrons can only be given new orders if they are within 36" of a ship with a Hanger upgrade. Squadrons that have not been given new orders maintain their old orders.</li>
                <li>To give an order to a squadron, choose a ship to assign the squadron to, then choose either Offensive mode, Defensive mode, or Dock.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Offensive mode: Squadrons have the effects described in their Effect Ladder based on their current squadron size. If the effect is not a static one and requires timing (for example, "deal 1 damage") that effect happens at the end of the activation of the ship that squadron was assigned to.</li>
                    <li>In Defensive mode: Squadrons are "escorting" the chosen ship, and act as a deterrent to other squadrons that may attack. Unless otherwise stated, those squadrons have no effect until an enemy squadron is assigned to the same ship that the defending squadron is assigned to. In such a case, a Dogfight begins. More details on Dogfighting can be found below.</li>
                    <li>Docking: To be given a dock order, the assigned ship must have an empty Hanger upgrade. Mark an empty hanger upgrade on the assigned ship with the type of squadron being docked. The squadron size need not be noted, relaunched Small Craft Squadrons are always launched at full strength (full squadron size).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Some upgrades and other parts of the rules reference "Making an attack against" a small craft squadron. <b>To make an attack against a squadron, roll a d6. If the result is greater than or equal to the toughness of the defending squadron, reduce it's squadron size by 1.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><u>Dogfighting:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>If a squadron is assigned to a ship, and there are also any enemy squadrons assigned to that ship, a Dogfight occurs over that ship. A dogfight ends when all squadrons assigned to the ship are one allied with each other (usually by being controlled by the same player).</li>
                <li>In a Dogfight, no effects from the Effect Ladder of any squadrons Dogfighting over a ship have any effect.</li>
                <li>Additionally, at the end of the assigned ship's Activation, for each squadron in the Dogfight, choose one other squadron in the Dogfight. Then make a number of attacks against the chosen squadron equal to the Squadron Size of the attack squadron. Resolve for each squadron simultaneously.</li>

    <h3 id="changelog"><u>Changelog</u></h3>
    <h4>July 28, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Organized All Upgrades into their own seperate tables.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>July 25, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HUGE UPDATE!!</li>
        <li>The movement system remains completely untouched, but just about everything to do with combat damage has been changed.</li>
        <li>Weapons now work the same and roll straight dice for damage. Most upgrades manipulate the dice through changeing the number of them rolled, rerolling them, or ignoring them after being rolled. All new weapon information is confined to the "Weapons" section, and reading that should easily familiarize you with all the new mechanics.</li>
        <li>Small Craft have also completely changed. Instead of being physicla units that move about the board, they now act like something closer to status effects assigned to a ship.</li>
        <li>Defenses have been added as another part of force creation. Each ship can equip 3 defenses as part of their kitting out process, each one tailored to defending against a different type of weapon. (Oh yeah, weapon types matter now).</li>
        <li>Lots of new upgrades, and a number of old upgrades have been changed to work with new existing mechanics. Be sure to check through upgrades before just slamming them on your ship, many work differently than before, Cloaking System being a notable one.</li>
        <li>Point Defense is much simpler now. Point Defense as a upgrade label is gone now, and any upgrades that interact with Small Craft or Missiles will specifically mention them in their effects, and generic point defenses for small craft are an option for equippable Defenses (previously mentioned).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>May 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Added Measure Tool Download Link</li>
        <li>Repair Crews: Added "Instead of restoring integrity points, you may instead choose to restore two destroyed systems" option to the rules text (System-Attacking strategies such as railgun spam need a release valve. Other upgrades may be proposed for similar adjustments)</li>
        <li>New Upgrade: Away Crews</li>
        <li>Small Craft Rules! New Upgrades to support this update: Efficient Hangars, Fabricator, Flight Deck, Nanite Repair Swarm, Reserve Reinforcements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Artillery: AP 1 -> 2 (Two Consecutive hits from Artillery pieces will still each proc crit rolls)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 22, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy Lance: Damage 3 -> 4 (Procs crit roll on one hit, but always destroys with both hits)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>April 16, 2024</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Repair Crews: "If this repair fills an integrity bar," -> "For each integrity bar this repair fills,"</li>
        <li>Railgun: Attacks 2 -> 3 (~75-87% chance to destroy a system every salvo is a big step towards making the Railgun perform it's intended job.)</li>
        <li>Millstone: Attacks 2 -> 3 (<i>Could</i> remove one whole integrity bar in a single salvo (~30% chance of all three hitting), but probably wont. Makes Millstone worth not ignoring)</li>
        <li>Artillery: Damage 6 -> 5 (No weapon should one shot a Corvette with no downside or without real work, forces the shooter to commit more than just one resource to one kill.)</li>
        <li>Torpedo: Damage 9 -> 8 (Most defensive upgrades will prevent the elimination of one row, most of the time.)</li>
        <li>Direct Fire Weapons: Step 7: Roll Additonal Crits, Added "for each attack that hit the target," (Clarifies that weapons with AP values >0 and multiple attacks should be rolling multiple times if more than one attack hits)</li>
        <li>Added Sub-Lists for jumping to weapon tables</li>
