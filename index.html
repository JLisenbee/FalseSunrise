    <h1><u>False Sunrise: Naval Wargame</u></h1>

    <h3><u>Proposed Features/Changes</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Small Craft (Hanger Module that holds one squadron, PD can shoot at squadrons, different types?)</li>
        <li>Factions (Each Will at least add 3 new weapons, 3 new upgrades, 1 new type of small craft, and a team-wide effect)</li>
        <li>Remove missile accuracy stat and add an accuracy stat to PD: Missiles may have too many "feels bad" points tht make them not worth taking/would make them hard to balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Pregame Setup</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4' x 6' play area with ~7-10 Pieces of terrain. Terrain is impassable and blocks line of sight.</li>
        <li>Players roll a die. <b>This is the initiative roll. The player that won the initive roll has the initiative.</b></li>
        <li>The player who has the initiative places an objective marker 12" from any table edge.</li>
        <li>Players alternate placing objective markers 12" from any board edge and 9" from each other objective until 5 are placed. </li>
        <li>The person who has the initiative chooses a board edge and places all of their ships within 12" of that edge. Then the player does not places all their ships in the same manner on the opposite edge.</li>
    <li>Play begins. <b>Ships start at 6 Thrust.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Turn Structure</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Order Phase</u>: Players secretly note their movement orders (rules for this is found in "Movement" below). Players then simultaneously reveal those orders. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Movement Phase</u>: For each ship, move it in accordance to the rules in "Movement" below. Since there is no ship-to-ship collision in False Sunrise, movement may be executed simultaneously.</li>
        <li><u>Weapons Phase</u>: The player who has the initiative chooses one ship to fire any or all of it's weapons. Then the player who does not chooses a ship to do the same. Alternate back and forth until all ships have fired.</li>
        <li><u>Points Phase</u>: Calculate points earned for this turn. (Refer to "Winning" below)</li>
        <li><u>End Phase</u>: Initiative transfers to the player who did not have it at the beginning of the turn, the turn ends, and the next turn begins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Movement</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a thrust value representing the power of their engines. This is not the actual distance a ship will move in a turn, but rather the "currency" they can spend to change the amount.</li>
        <li><u>Accelerating</u>: Up to all of a ship's thrust can go towards increasing it's velocity. A ship is not required to accelerate or decelerate, and instead choose to maintain it's current velocity.</li>
        <li><u>Changing course</u>: Up to half of a ship's thrust can be used to make course changes. Courses changes are made either to Port (left) or Starboard (right) and each point of course change changes the couyrse of the ship by one "hour" distance as if referencing a clock face (See included Tool). Course changes are always all port or all starboard, and cannot be split between the two.</li>
        <li><u>Executing Movement</u>: Movement is carried out following the steps below.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded down.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Rotate the ship a number of "hour spaces" equal to <b>half it's course change this turn, rounded up.</b></li>
            <li>Move the ship forward a number of inches equal to <b>half it's velocity rounded down.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <li><b>Note: If a ship's path when moving would intersect a piece of terrain</b> it immediately stops, it's thrust is reduced to zero, and it takes damage equal to the number of inches it would have moved passed the point where it stopped (it's remaining "unallocated" velocity).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Winning</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When a ship moves within 3 inches of the center of an objective marker, that marker is claimed for them.</li>
        <li>At the end of each round (after all ships have had a chance to shoot), each player earns one point for each marker claimed by them.</li>
        <li><b>Once a player has earned 15 points, the game ends and that player wins.</b></li>  
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Force Construction</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Choosing a Total Integrity</u>: When constructing a force, first decide on a maximum amount of integrity points each team's fleet should total up to. </li>
        <li>Ship hulls have an associated integrity value based on their relative size and capability, and equal integrity per fleet insures roughly equal sides (A good starting point is 20)</li>
        <li><u>Choosing Hulls</u>: Ship hulls have a number of slots for components (weapons and upgrades) equal to their integrity value. Players choose the hulls they wish to use up to the agreed upon Total Integrity.</li>
        <li>For each ship hull, you choose a number of components (weapons or upgrades) from the lists below equal to the Ship hull's integrity value. Any limitations or special rules for mounting that component will be noted in the descripion of that component.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Hulls</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ships have a number of slots for components equal to their integrity value.</li>
        <li>Ships have a number of Integrity Rows, 6 pips each, equal to their integrity.</li>
        <li>When a row is depleted, destroy one system on the ship.</li>
        <li>When all rows are depleted, the ship is destroyed.</li>
        <li>Systems: Components (weapons/upgrades), Thrusters (Half Thrust When Destroyed), Fire Control (-3 to hit with all weapons when destroyed), CiC (Fire Weapons or Apply Thrust, not both)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Corvette</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrity: 1</li>
        <li>Thrust: 10</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><u>Direct Fire Weapons</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct fire weapons fire out of the fore arc, either one of the side arcs, or the rear arc. <b>This is chosen during force creation.</b></li>
        <li>Direct Fire Weapons require line of sight.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a defined number of attacks. When firing this weapon, shoot it that many times. You may split those shots among any number of targets.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a defined range. This range defines the width of the Range Bands (RB) that weapon uses. (Within that range from the ship is RB 1, from 1x that range and 2x that range is RB 2, etc). Weapons hit on 2+ in Range Band 1, and the difficulty increases by 1 for each range band (RB 2 is 3+, RB 3 is 4+, etc)</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have a Damage value. Weapons deal damage based on their Damage to the target's integrity.</li>
        <li>Direct fire weapons have an Armor Piercing value. After dealing damage to a ship, check the ship's remaining integrity. If the armor piercing value is greater than the number of integrity points left in the current row, roll a d6. On a 4+, destroy another system on the ship.</li>
